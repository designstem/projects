### About

The project covers the full <var>design engineering</var> cycle, starting with <var style="color: var(--gray)">problem statement</var>, moving on to <var style="color: var(--gray)">background research</var>, <var style="color: var(--gray)">design</var>, <var style="color: var(--gray)">engineering</var>, <var style="color: var(--gray)">iterative prototyping</var> and finally <var style="color: var(--gray)">communication</var>.

The case study includes **Philips hue** lighting system, we are learning what makes smart lights work — from engineering, user experience and marketing side.

### Motivation

The idea to create this scenario due the vital importance of the RGB color model for graphics designers. 

The RGB color model is pervasively used for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as computers, scanners, digital photo cameras and digital video cameras.
