### About

The project covers the full <var>design engineering</var> cycle, starting with <var style="color: var(--gray)">problem statement</var>, moving on to <var style="color: var(--gray)">background research</var>, <var style="color: var(--gray)">design</var>, <var style="color: var(--gray)">engineering</var>, <var style="color: var(--gray)">iterative prototyping</var> and finally <var style="color: var(--gray)">communication</var>.

The case study includes **Philips hue** lighting system, we are learning what makes smart lights work â€” from engineering, user experience and marketing side.

### Motivation

> ~*The idea to create this scenario due the vital importance of the RGB color model for graphics designers. <br/>The RGB color model is pervasively used for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as computers, scanners, digital photo cameras and digital video cameras.*~
