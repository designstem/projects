## Let's start

-

Look at the [Philips hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) commercial on the right. Discuss the following questions. Write down your answers:

1. What problem does the product solve?
  
2. How does it affect the lives of its users?

3. How does it work? What can it do? How does it react to user input?

4. Which electric and software components might it have?

<br> 

All these questions are at the core of <var>design engineering</var>. Let's start exploring how it works.

# Define the Problem

The engineering design process starts when you ask the following questions about problems that you observe:

#### 1. What is the need?

#### 2. Who has the need?

#### 3. Why is it important to satisfy the need?

**Take notes of the core facts, while you read through the pages**

You will need this information for your final task.

## Light and plants

Did you know that light is one of the most critical factors in healthy plant growth? Plants, unlike humans, can make their food through a process called photosynthesis.

The correct color of light, along with water and nutrient soil, will provide a plant with the sustenance of life.

**By the way, plants prefer blue and red light.**

These two-color qualities have the most significant influence on how a plant grows. Blue lights' responsibility is to promote leaf and vegetable growth, while red when combined with blue, will make a plant flower.

## Light and psychology

<var>Color psychology</var> is the study of hues as a determinant of human behavior. Color influences the perception, such as the taste of food <f-link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology">Source</f-link>

Further, colored light is used in stores to make certain products more attractive to buyers: Fish counters are often lighted cold blue hue to make the food more attractive while meat counters have warm yellow hues.

<caption>üíªüí¨ Research and discuss</caption>

1. Find out about the term **color temperature**.

2. Is it really a temperature, i.e., is the color hot or cold?

3. In the example, they use blue light for fish counters. Why is that?

4. Where else could this knowledge be used, other than in the supermarket?

# Design

-

### 1. Specify Requirements

<!--Design requirements state the essential characteristics that your solution must meet to succeed.-->

One of the best ways to identify the design requirements for your solution is to analyze the concrete example of a similar, existing product, noting each of its key features.

-

### 2. Brainstorm Solutions

There are always many ways of solving design problems. If you focus on just one before looking at the alternatives, it is almost certain that you are overlooking a better solution. Good designers try to generate as many possible solutions as they can. This not only applies to brand design and product design but also architecture and other design fields. <f-link to="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-process-steps">Read more</a>

In the final task, you will design your RGB lamp! But not just a pretty lamp, but one with a <var>specific function</var>.

Before your planning goes into detail on the next slide (which will help you on your design journey), **let's do some brainstorming!** 

</section>

<section>

**Think of a situation in your everyday life, where an RGB lamp might be useful**. 

Think back to the **Philips hue** - they used it for deaf people to indicate that the doorbell rang. Maybe an RGB lamp that is tailored to someones' needs might be useful for your friend, family, or even you? Where could you use it? At home? At school? In which situations would it be useful? In the morning? While you play video games? While you eat?

2. What is its primary function? Remember your research results before e.g., information, communication, health, psychology.

3. Which properties/features does your lamp need according to your target group and the situation that it will be used in?

4. In which way will your RGB lamp interact with the environment or people?

5. Which input from the environment does your lamp react to (e.g., time, light, noise, music, temperature, heart rate, feelings...)?

# Engineering

-

### 1. Choose the best idea

Look at whether each possible solution/idea meets your design requirements. Some solutions probably meet more requirements than others. Reject solutions that do not meet the requirements!

-

### 2. Develop the idea

Development involves the refinement and improvement of an idea, and it continues throughout the design process, often even after product ships to customers.
-

### 3. Test and redesign

The design process involves multiple iterations and redesigns of your final solution. You will likely test it, find new problems, make changes, and test again before settling on a final design. This is important, so don't be lazy! üòâ

-

Don't stop developing, even if you are content with the result in between. **There is always a better solution at the horizon.**

| section: How is color produced?
| 1 1 1

## How is color produced in devices?

-

Before you start to build your RGB lamp, you need to understand how RGB works. 

The RGB color model is an <var>additive color model</var> in which red, green, and blue light are added together to reproduce a broad array of colors. Our eyes also work with RGB because we have red, green, and blue cones in our retina.

-

##### Try to produce white light in the center

<f-slider title="Red" value="64" to="255" integer set="r" />

<f-slider title="Green" value="128" to="255" integer set="g" />

<f-slider title="Blue" value="196" to="255" integer set="b" />

For further information, see also the workshop on  <a href="../colorblindness/">Color Vision Deficiency</a> There you will find a detailed explanation of the RGB model and also tasks that will help you understand it better.

1. What is the relationship between environmental parameters and colors?
2. How do you interpolate the missing values? (E.g. spline, keyframes)

# Prototyping

-

### 1. Build a Prototype

A prototype is an operating version of a solution. Often it is made with different materials than the final version, and generally, it is not as polished. Prototypes are a key step in the development of an ultimate solution, allowing the designer to test how the solution will work. 

-

### 2. Test and Redesign

The design process involves multiple iterations and redesigns of your final solution. You will likely test your solution, find new problems, make changes, and test new solutions before settling on a final design. <f-link to="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-process-steps">Read more</a>

# Make a lamp prototype

### Key steps

1. Based on your analysis and your planning before, make a scribble of your lamp and lampshade. Remember not only to draw it from the front but also from the side and from above as a reference for your production.
2. Use cardboard or any other material of your choice and create a dummy for your lampshade. This dummy should help you and others visualize how it will look like and also to find flaws in the design, which you need to eliminate.
3. Based on your dummy, analyze your product and correct it if necessary.
4. Discuss your prototype in class.

Remember the [Philips hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) commercial? Watch it again but focus on how the product is **communicated**. Try to answer the following questions:

1. Who promotes the product?
  
2. How is music used?

3. How often do you see the actual product and the app controlling it?

4. And most important: **How does the commercial make you feel**?

All these questions are the core of <var>marketing</var>, the art of selling not just a product, but also a feeling.

## Prepare your presentation

-

How will you make people interested in what you did? Follow the questions below, to help you prepare your presentation:

#### TASKS

1. Describe your ideal customer.
2. In which way does your product add value to the customer's life?
3. How can you articulate this value to the customer in 15 words or less? Can you put it in just one slogan?
4. Why is your idea better than the alternatives?

<br>

Create an outline for your presentation to convince your audience of your product's value. Think of the storytelling of good movies: They start with an exciting beginning (a riddle), then build-up to the solution and have a grande finale!
