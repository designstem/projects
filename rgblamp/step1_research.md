## Light and health

<var>Biodynamic lighting</var> is an artificial light source that replicates the dynamic variations of daylight and sunlight through a light management system.

<var>Chronobiology</var> is a field of biology that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to solar- and lunar-related rhythms.

#### TASK

1. Find out more about biodynamic lighting and Chronobiology online. 
2. Find out what light has to do with health.
3. In which way does light influence our bodies?

## Light and plants

Did you know, that light is one of the most important factors in healthy plant growth? Plants, unlike humans, can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis.

The correct color of light, along with water and nutrient soil, will provide a plant with the sustenance of life.

**By the way, plants prefer blue and red light.**

These two color qualities have the greatest influence on how a plant grows. Blue lights' responsibility is to promote leaf and vegetable growth, while red, when combined with blue, will make a plant flower.

## Light and psychology

<var>Color psychology</var> is the study of hues as a determinant of human behavior. Color influences the perception, such as the taste of food <f-link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology">Source</f-link>

Further, colored light is used in stores to make certain products more attractive to buyers: Fish counters are often lighted cold blue hue to make the food more attractive while meat counters have warm yellow hues.

#### TASK

1. Find out about the term **color temperature**.
2. Is it really a temperature, i.e. is the color hot or cold?
3. In the example they use blue light for fish counters. Why is that?
4. Where else could this knowledge be used, other than in the supermarket?
