# Design

-

### 1. Specify Requirements

<!--Design requirements state the important characteristics that your solution must meet to succeed.-->

One of the best ways to identify the design requirements for your solution is to analyze the concrete example of a similar, existing product, noting each of its key features.

-

### 2. Brainstorm Solutions

There are always many ways for solving design problems. If you focus on just one before looking at the alternatives, it is almost certain that you are overlooking a better solution. Good designers try to generate as many possible solutions as they can. This not only applies to brand design and product design, but also to architecture and other design fields. <f-link to="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-process-steps">Read more</a>

In the final task, you will design your own RGB lamp! But not just a pretty lamp, but one with a <var>specific function</var>.

Before your planning goes into detail on the next slide (which will help you on your design journey), **let's do some brainstorming!** 

</section>

-

<section>

**Think of a situation in your everyday life, where an RGB lamp might be useful**. 

Think back to the **Philips hue** - they used it for deaf people to indicate that the doorbell rang. Maybe an RGB lamp that is tailored to someones' needs, might be useful for your friend, family or even you? Where could you use it? At home? At school? In which situations would it be useful? In the morning? While you play video games? While you eat?

**When you have come up with a rough idea of what you want to produce, let's move to next step**

You have still got your rough idea in mind? Then let's start planning! üôÇ

**Write down as many idea as possible, more than one ideea is a requirement**

When you answer these questions, try to be *as precise as possible.* The better you plan, the better the outcome. Take your time and don't rush it.

#### Key questions:

1. What is your target group? Is there a certain person that you will design it for? What does your target group need or expect?

2. What is its basic function? Remember your research results of before e.g. information, communication, health, psychology...

3. Which properties/features does your lamp need according to your target group and the situation that it will be used in?

4. In which way will your RGB lamp interact with the environment or people?

5. Which input from the environment does your lamp react to (e.g. time, light, noise, music, temperature, heart rate, feelings...)?
