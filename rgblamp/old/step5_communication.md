# Communication

**Now it is time to complete your project!** üßê

#### TASKS

1. Build a complete prototype, i.e. combine your lamp shade with your RGB lamp!
2. Write a short essay, documenting your design process and explaining your design choices.
3. Be prepared to present your results!

<br>

Professional engineers always do the same, thoroughly documenting their solutions so that they can be manufactured and supported.<f-link to="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-process-steps">Read more</a>

## Marketing

-

Remember the [Philips hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) commercial? Watch it again but focus on how the product is **communicated**. Try to answer the following questions:

1. Who promotes the product?
  
2. How is the music is used?

3. How often do you see the actual product and the app controlling it?

4. And most important: **How does the commercial make you feel**?

All these questions are the core of <var>marketing</var>, the art of selling not just a product, but also a feeling.

##  Prepare your presentation

-

How will you make people interested in what you did? Follow the questions below, to help you prepare your presentation:

#### TASKS

1. Describe your ideal customer.
2. In which way, does your product add value to the customer's life?
3. How can you articulate this value to the customer in 15 words or less? Can you put it in just one slogan?
4. Why is your idea better than the alternatives?

<br>

Create an outline for your presentation, to convince your audience of your product's value. Think of the story telling of good movies: They start with an interesting beginning (a riddle), then build up to the solution and have a grande finale!
