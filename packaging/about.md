### About

Students learn how products’ packaging is strongly connected to geometrical properties; they discover and reflect about geometrical optimizations of containers in animal and vegetable worlds and, more importantly, how Nature can inspire packaging designers to reduce packaging and materials waste problems.


### Motivation

> ~*Most, if not all, the products we buy are provided in a package. Nowadays, the reduction of waste produced by packaging is one essential action to achieve The Global Goal For Sustainable Development n°12 : responsible consumption and production.<br/>Based on everyday experience, the scenario offers the possibility to reflect on packaging, its marketing rules and its effects on consumers environment.Students gain awareness about the importance of geometry for the design of packages and for their storage, always keeping the natural world as a source of guidance and inspiration.<br/>At the end of the scenario students are challenged to rethink a product package in a more sustainable way with a special focus on reusability. An apparently small challenge to bring the students discuss how every person can contribute to achieve Global Goals For Sustainable Development and strengthen the citizenship competences.*~
