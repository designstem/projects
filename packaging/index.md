## What next?

In this workshop, you will look at different aspects regarding packaging design and use knowledge in mathematics to complete your final task sucessfully.

We will be focussing on packaging made out of cardboard, but there are so many other ways to "wrap" products. But the main aims are always the same:

* Protect the product (against damage, stealing...)
* Make the product look more appealing from the outside (sell the product to the customer)

<br>

**Enjoy exploring!** ðŸ™‚

## Human made packaging

Whenever products are sold, they need to be protected for their transport, before their use. Whether salesmen wrap fish into old newspaper at a market or whether we have high-end hifi products that are put into shiny, colorful packaging. Packaging has always been there whenever there were products which have been sold and/or transported.

1. The evolution of packaging is strongly related to human history. Watch the following video and find out more:

    <f-video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=xz9UM9ZVvXY" />
  </details>

2. Look for packaging around you and find differences between them regarding their shape. Compare the shape to the product inside. In which way does the packaging mirror the inside?

3. Take pictures of these packagings for future reference.

## Fraud packaging

Today, packaging is not only protection but also marketing and therefore, often misleading! 

On the right, you can see an X-Ray of a cocoa package, showing the amount of product in relation to the size of the packaging.

#### TASKS

1. Look through your cupboards at home or walk through your neighborhood supermarket: Are there any product packagings that are misleading (i.e. content is smaller than the packaging suggests)?

2. What do you think and feel about it?

3. Which environmental consequences do fraud packages have?

### Costly packaging

Sometimes the value of the package is higher than the value of the product itself, depending on the material in use and the further processing to make the product look more valuable.

-

### Precious packaging

Sometimes the package is part of the value, like with perfume bottles. Some people even collect them. Walk through a perfume store and look at the different and extraordinary shapes. No one would put so much effort into designing bottles, if it wasn't what the customer wanted.
<f-arrow-icon /> ~***Which other examples for precious packaging can you find?***~

### Ethic packaging

 Reducing packaging is an ethic mission &ndash; **always**! And it is getting out of hand, because one product can be wrapped multiple times, e.g. cornflakes. They are wrapped in a plastic bag, inside a cardboard box.

<f-arrow-icon /> ~***Find other examples for multiple times wrapped products. What is the purpose?***~

## Packaging in nature

Nature has always evolved the best packaging for its products. 

#### TASK

Where in nature can you find packaging examples? Think of fruits for example.

<br>

But let's think further:
**How can we optimize packaging?**

Let's compare perimeter vs volume!
-

<span class="bullet">1</span>  Bring/take a milk or juice carton (square shape). Cut off the top of the carton and fill it with rice until it is full.

<span class="bullet">2</span> Weigh the rice on a scale without the carton (pour it into a bowl). Note the weight!

<span class="bullet">3</span> Also, cut off the bottom of the carton and cut along one of the sides, to open it up..

## Eplore: Polygons with fixed perimeter


**Experiment how polygons area changes**

1. Start changing only the dimension of a square and a triangle with the same <var>perimeter</var> <f-math inline :update="get('p')">p = \color{red}{ {{ get('p') }} }</f-math>

  <f-slider set="p" from="1" to="10" />

  <small>

  Which is the ratio between square and triangle areas?<br>What can you say about the volume of a milk carton with triangle base?

  </small>

2. Now keep a fixed perimeter of <f-math inline red>10</f-math> and change the <var>number of edges</var> <f-math inline :update="get('n')">n = \color{red}{ {{ get('n') }} }</f-math>

  <f-slider set="n" from="3" to="32" integer >
  </f-slider>

  <small>

  How do the ratio between square and polygons change?
  Given a fixed perimeter, which is the polygon with the biggest area?
  What can you say about the volume of the milk carton?
  Have you ever seen packages where the base is not square?

## Multiple packaging

Take a lemon or an orange. Think about its parts and its packaging subdivision.

Sometimes natural packagings do not optimize the amount per se, but they maximize the **outer container utilization**.

## Bees and packaging


Find out how honeycombs are built and why bees choose hexagons and not other regular polygons. 

1. Watch the video

2. Verify that the hexagon has the maximum area among the stackable polygons with same perimeter.

3. Verify that the hexagon has the minimum perimeter among the stackable polygons with same area.

## Bees and packaging


Honeycombs are not only used for packaging, but also for **packaging materials**.

<blockquote>

Cardboard honeycomb panels consist of two supporting surface layers and a honeycomb core, similar to that of a honeycomb from a beehive.
	
</blockquote>


#### Tasks

1. Research further possible applications for honeycomb cardboards. Where are they used else, other than packaging?
2. Find out the advantages honeycomb cardboard has, in comparison to wood or other materials. What makes it so attractive to work with?

## Natural marketing in packaging 

Sometimes in nature the **packaging is part of the product**.

1. Take an apple. Think about its skin, core and seeds. What is product and what is packaging?

2. Do you know about a human made product having a package that is part of the product? Research on the internet if neccessary!

3. What do you think about products where the package is part of the product? What are advantages and what are disadvantages?

<caption>Final assignment</caption>

## <f-activity-icon /> Design your own packaging!

Now that you've learned so much about packaging, it's time that you design one yourself. Choose one of the following three tasks:

#### <mark> TASK A </mark> 

1. Choose an object that you want to design a cardboard package for. You can use multiple small objects (like rice, cornflakes, pasta etc.) or a bigger object.

2. Remember what you've learned about fraud packaging. Sometimes a little air inside is needed to protect the product during a bumpy ride, but too much is misleading. Plan your sizing carefully! Decide upon a shape that is best.

3. What if you have to store/stack several packages? How could you optimize the shape of your package in order to reduce loss of space between them?

4. Additional task: Think about the packaging inside the cardboard package. Fragile objects need extra packaging. How can you guarantee that the object won't break, while trying not to waste material?


#### <mark> TASK B </mark>

1. Try to design a reusable package, possibly suitable for different purposes. Take this example: At LUSH, you will get reusable packaging for soaps, so you'll go there and can get a refil into your old packaging.

2. Choose a product for your reusable packaging.

3. Evaluate whatâ€™s the best material for your package; keep in mind that it has to be reusable! 

4. What if you have to store/stack several packages, how could you optimize the shape of your package in order to reduce loss of space between them?


#### <mark> TASK C </mark>

1. Design a packaging for different spices which together will form a pattern but can be used individually! It should not only be functional, but also look unusual/nice/fresh.

2. Make scribbles to plan your modules and the complete packaging including all modules.

3. Evaluate whatâ€™s the best material for your package.

<br>

**For both tasks**: Create a dummy of your packaging and be ready to explain why you designed it this way!

<f-next-button />


<f-notes style="--primary: var(--darkgray)" >

### Additional information

Depending on your students' proficiency, you can also let them design the layout of the packaging itself, that means add texts, logo, pictures etc. Maybe also come up with ideas for refinement to make the packaging more appealing.

##  Evaluate your packaging

**Congratulations on creating your packaging!** Let's have a closer look!

1. What was most difficult about designing it? Where did you struggle?
2. What did you learn about packaging design? Is there anything new that you didn't know yet?
3. On a daily basis, we throw away cardboard packagings or recycle them. This immensely increased throughout the last fifty years. But also plastic is being used massively for packaging. Can you imagine alternatives? Browse the internet to find new ideas on alternatives for cardboard or plastic packaging.
