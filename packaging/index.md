## What next?

~In this workshop, you will look at different aspects regarding packaging design and use knowledge in mathematics to complete your final task sucessfully.~

~We will be focussing on packaging made out of cardboard, but there are so many other ways to "wrap" products. But the main aims are always the same:~

* Protect the product (against damage, stealing...)
* Make the product look more appealing from the outside (sell the product to the customer)

<br>

~**Enjoy exploring!**~ 🙂

## Human made packaging

Whenever products are sold, they need to be protected for their transport, before their use. Whether salesmen wrap fish into old newspaper at a market or whether we have high-end hifi products that are put into shiny, colorful packaging. Packaging has always been there whenever there were products which have been sold and/or transported.

1. The evolution of packaging is strongly related to human history. Watch the following video and find out more:

  <details>
    <summary>Watch the video overview</summary>
    <f-video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=xz9UM9ZVvXY" />
  </details>

2. Look for packaging around you and find differences between them regarding their shape. Compare the shape to the product inside. In which way does the packaging mirror the inside?

3. Take pictures of these packagings for future reference.

## Fraud packaging

Today, packaging is not only protection but also marketing and therefore, often misleading! 

On the right, you can see an X-Ray of a cocoa package, showing the amount of product in relation to the size of the packaging.

#### TASKS

1. Look through your cupboards at home or walk through your neighborhood supermarket: Are there any product packagings that are misleading (i.e. content is smaller than the packaging suggests)?

2. What do you think and feel about it?

3. Which environmental consequences do fraud packages have?

### Costly packaging

Sometimes the value of the package is higher than the value of the product itself, depending on the material in use and the further processing to make the product look more valuable.
<f-arrow-icon /> ~**Find other examples!**~

-

### Precious packaging

Sometimes the package is part of the value, like with perfume bottles. Some people even collect them. Walk through a perfume store and look at the different and extraordinary shapes. No one would put so much effort into designing bottles, if it wasn't what the customer wanted.
<f-arrow-icon /> ~**Which other examples for precious packaging can you find?**~

### Ethic packaging

 Reducing packaging is an ethic mission &ndash; **always**! And it is getting out of hand, because one product can be wrapped multiple times, e.g. cornflakes. They are wrapped in a plastic bag, inside a cardboard box.

<f-arrow-icon /> ~**Find other examples for multiple times wrapped products. What is the purpose?**~

## Packaging in nature

Nature has always evolved the best packaging for its products. 

#### TASK

~Where in nature can you find packaging examples? Think of fruits for example.~

<br>

But let's think further:
**How can we optimize packaging?**

<span class="bullet">2</span> Weigh the rice on a scale without the carton (pour it into a bowl). Note the weight!

<span class="bullet">3</span> Also, cut off the bottom of the carton and cut along one of the sides, to open it up..

<span class="bullet">5</span> Which shape optimizes the carton's volume?

## Eplore: Polygons with fixed perimeter


**Experiment how polygons area changes**

1. Start changing only the dimension of a square and a triangle with the same <var>perimeter</var> <f-math inline :update="get('p')">p = \color{red}{ {{ get('p') }} }</f-math>

  <f-slider set="p" from="1" to="10" />

  <small>

  Which is the ratio between square and triangle areas?<br>What can you say about the volume of a milk carton with triangle base?

  </small>

2. Now keep a fixed perimeter of <f-math inline red>10</f-math> and change the <var>number of edges</var> <f-math inline :update="get('n')">n = \color{red}{ {{ get('n') }} }</f-math>

  <f-slider set="n" from="3" to="32" integer >
  </f-slider>

  <small>

  How do the ratio between square and polygons change?
  Given a fixed perimeter, which is the polygon with the biggest area?
  What can you say about the volume of the milk carton?
  Have you ever seen packages where the base is not square?

  </small>

## Multiple packaging

Take a lemon or an orange. Think about its parts and its packaging subdivision.

Sometimes natural packagings do not optimize the amount per se, but they maximize the **outer container utilization**.

## Bees and packaging


Find out how honeycombs are built and why bees choose hexagons and not other regular polygons. 

1. Watch the video

2. Verify that the hexagon has the maximum area among the stackable polygons with same perimeter.

3. Verify that the hexagon has the minimum perimeter among the stackable polygons with same area.

Sometimes in nature the **packaging is part of the product**.

2. Do you know about a human made product having a package that is part of the product?

## Create a package

1. Imagine how you can design a new reusable package, possibly suitable for different purposes

2. Evaluate what’s the best material for your package; keep in mind that it has to be reusable 

3. What if you have to store several packages, how could you optimize the shape of your package in order to reduce loss of space between them?
