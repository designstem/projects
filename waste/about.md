### Learning goals

Today it is more obvious than ever before that we face environmental challenges. We see that waste is actually a design mistake that can be traced back to decisions made on the designer's drawing table. The present e-learning project gives guidelines to deal with material as efficiently as possible, to optimize strength in construction - a quality to be found in trees, plants, bones or even soap bubbles. Also, guidelines are provided to avoid producing waste in the manufacturing process. 

### Motivation

With Greta Thunberg as an example of worldwide youth environmental movement, this topic does not need much explanation. The importance of creating environmental awareness is essential to make a transition to a more sustainable, healthier world. For this transition one needs to think differently, look differently and act in correspondence to change. Who else could do this better than the youth - the future designers of our world?
