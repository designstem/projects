# <big>From geometry to design</big>

<big>_Go on a journey of polyhedrons and icosahedrons..._</big>

<f-notes title="Outline" width="50vw" style="--primary: var(--darkgray)">

## Scenario outline

1. Discover the slide-together technique which uses two-dimensional shape to create a three-dimensional object

2. Make a modular polyhedra model from 20 pieces paper triangles

3. Icosahedron explanation

4. How can the math model be base for designing a useful object? What creates a difference? See https://foroalfa.org/en/articles/from-the-useful-object-to-the-object-tool

5. Based on the modular polyhedra model, create your object by changing triangle shape so you can't recognize geometry, from geometry to model with emotion and character.

## The icosahedron is a 20-faced polyhedron

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: 5rem">
    <f-image src="./images/ico2.png" 
    style="mix-blend-mode: screen; filter: invert(1); --image-size: contain; --image-position: center; width: 6rem" />
    <f-image src="./images/ico1.png"

    style="mix-blend-mode: screen; filter: invert(1); --image-size: contain; --image-position: center; width: 10rem" />
</div>

When balanced on a point, the icosahedron can be understood as a "ring" of 10 triangular faces with a rosette of 5 faces above and another rosette of 5 below.

## Who Discovered the Icosahedron?

It has been suggested that the regular icosahedron is the first example of a geometrical object that was the free creation of human thought, not the result of observations in nature...

## Viruses

...probably because icosahedrons can't be seen in nature with the naked eye. At the microscopic scale, things can be different - viruses can be of various geometric shapes, including icosahedra. This is a diagram of an Adenovirus.

<section>

## Let's make a _polyhedra_ model!

One way to make a _polyhedra_ model is by **folding** paper and gluing it together. To do that, you can:

1. Print out a worksheet on a plain A3 paper

   <a class="tertiary" href="./files/geometry_fold.pdf" style="margin-bottom: .8em"><f-download-icon /> Download</a>

2. Cut out the layout of the polyhedra by following the continuous lines.

3. Fold the polyhedra, line up the corresponding numbers and glue them together.

## ...or better yet, discover the _slide-together_ technique

**which uses a two-dimensional shape to create a three-dimensional object**

Nature has been called the greatest designer. Let us learn natureâ€™s design process and are creative ourselves. How does nature create? **Repetition**, repeating patterns.

Geometric patterns are a useful tool in graphic design, but not only. Geometric 3D models can give ideas for creating everyday domestic objects with beauty and character.

## Now let's make a <var>modular</var> polyhedra model...

...using the **slide-together** technique:

1. Print out a worksheet on 160 g/mÂ² A4 paper

   <a class="tertiary" href="./files/geometry_slidetogether.pdf" style="margin-bottom: .8em"><f-download-icon /> Download</a>

2. Cut out 20 pieces of triangles with slits at the proper locations

3. Slide the triangles together

## Why paper?

We are reaching the end of our short geometrical journey, but â€” ~_why use your hands and paper?_~ â€” may you ask?

Alongside _high-tech trends_, it is just as important to experiment with your own hands. Using our hands will eventually lead us to a world of sophisticated design and science.

As in the digital world, there is no limit to the hands-on method, moreover, expanding its boundaries is equally accessible to everyone.

Let's start with **the humble sheet of paper**, an ordinary and available material.
