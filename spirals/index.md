# Discovering Spirals

Spiral is a very common shape in nature and in as well as every day life. In the natural world, we may find spirals in the DNA double helix, the fingerprint, the flowers, the snails and shells but also in the galaxies, the hurricanes etc. Even the shape of an egg can be seen as a special type of spiral.

<!-- 3. Background -->

# Basics of trigonometry, Polar coordinates

In order to design a spiral you first need to recall the basic knowledge from trigonometry, a know the basic notation of trigonometry which is the branch of mathematics dealing with the relations of the sides and angles of triangles.

## The sides of an orthogonal triangle

Assume that there is an orthogonal triangle (a triangle with one angle equal to 90o). The side that is always is always opposite the right angle is called “hypotenuse”. This is the longest side in the orthogonal triangle.

If we choose an angle θ other the right angle, the side that lies opposite to it is called  “opposite”. The third angle, not in the opposite side is called “adjacent” sides. Next figure  shows the sides of the orthogonal triangle, labeled a, b and c.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/triangle.jpg)

The length of the three sides a, b and c of an orthogonal triangle are linked with “Pythagorean equation” equation

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq1.jpg?w=134&h=42&zoom=2)

This equation states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

## Trigonometric Ratios

The ratios (fractions) of the sides a, b and c  of an orthogonal right triangle are called trigonometric ratios. Three common trigonometric ratios are the sine (**sin**), cosine (**cos**), and tangent (**tan**). For any angle θ such that of the triangle in Figure 1, these are defined for as follows:

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq21.jpg)

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq31.jpg)

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq41.jpg)

To remember these definitions, note the following :

Sine = Opposite ÷ Hypotenuse

Cosine = Adjacent ÷ Hypotenuse

Tangent = Opposite ÷ Adjacent

By applying the Pythagorean equation to the trigonometric ratios derives that, for any angle θ  in an orthogonal triangle holds

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq6.jpg)

#### Example

Let the triangle ABC with length sides 5, 4 and 3.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/triangle1.jpg?w=135&zoom=2)

In the above triangle ABC,  the trigonometric ratios of the angle A are calculated:

<f-math>
sin(A) = \frac{CB}{AB} = \frac{3}{5}= 0.6
</f-math>

<f-math>
cos(A) = \frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
</f-math>

<f-math>
tan(A) = \frac{CD}{AC} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
</f-math>

or by using the values of sin A and cos A  tan A=sin A / cos A = 0.6/0.8 = 0.75.

In this example we can verify that 

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq5.jpg)

Moreover,  

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq72.jpg)


## Cartesian and Polar Coordinates 

Any point in the plane can be defined by its coordinates (**X**, **Y**). (X, Y) is a pair of numbers denoting the distances from two perpendicular lines: the vertical line (-axis) and the horizontal line (-axis). For example, in the next figure  the point A is defined as a pair (3,4) , where X=3 and Y=4. These are called Cartesian coordinates.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/plane11.jpg)

However, in many cases such that of drawing a spiral, a different expression is needed. One may notice that instead of using (x , y) as the coordinates of point A, the distance from the zero point r and the angle θ may equivalently be used. This means that the position of any point in the plane can be described by the pair (r, θ). These are called Polar coordinates of the point A.

Cartesian and Polar coordinates are equivalent and can be converted from one type to another.

#### Example 1. Find the Polar coordinates

Assume that  a point A(3,4)  is given. According to the next figure, the grey triangle is orthogonal with opposite and adjacent sides equal to y=4 and x=3, respectively.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/plane21.jpg)

The hypotenuse is the distance r and can be estimated by applying the Pythagorean equation as

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq8.jpg)

From the same triangle, angle θ can be estimated indirectly in terms of the tan(θ) ratio.

Indeed

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq9.jpg)

Note the value of  θ derives by the  inverse function of tan. Any typical scientific calculator includes this option.

## Example 2

Following the Example 1 , assume now that the point A is known by its polar coordinates (5, 53,06º). Its Cartesian coordinates derive by applying the trigonometric ratios cos() and sin() as follows.

# Mathematics of 2D and 3D Archimedean spirals

This section will help you understand the mathematics and particular the equations and formulas from which 2D and 3D spirals derive.

## Equations of 2D Archimedean spirals

Assume that a point is described by its polar coordinates (r, θ). Remember that r is the radius, the distance of the point from the center of the axes and θ is the angle formed between the radius and x axis (see next figure).

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/spiral2d-2.jpg?w=300&h=261)

Now, image what happens if the angle θ gradually  increases from the zero degrees (θ=0º) to θ=90º and then to θ=180º up to θ=360º. If the radius *r* remains constant , the corresponding point, will move along the blue circle.   This is the basic movement to produce a spiral shape.

In the previous movement, if we assume that *r* is not constant but increases gradually as the angle θ ranges from 0º to 360º, then we get a perfect spiral shape.

To draw an Archimedian spiral, two basic parameters need to define :

*   the starting point on the x axis (lets call it **α**) and
*   the distance **d** between two consecutive lines of the spiral.

The most usual case  of an Archimedian spiral is that when the spiral shape begins from the beginning of the axes x and y. In such a case  α=0.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/spiral2d-3.jpg?w=300&h=276)

Any point (x,y) of the plane belongs to a spiral shape if satisfies the following equations

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/eq11.jpg?w=300&h=138)

Note that π is the well known pi number equal to 3.14159.

The following figure, explains the above equations in terms of the polar coordinates explained in the previous section.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/spiral2d-1.jpg?w=1024&h=671)

Based on the above equations,  any flat, 2D Archimedian spiral can be drawn if the angle θ ranges from 0º to 360º, and for every single value in that range, the coordinates  x and y are calculated and the corresponding point (x,y) in plotted in the plane.

## Equations of 3D spirals

The equations of  a 3D spiral or helix are similar to those presented above.

In three dimensions we assume that a third axis z denoting the height is added to the plane. For that new axis and the two horizontal x, y , the equations are as follows:

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/eq121.jpg?w=300&h=148)

In the above equations, **R** represents the radius of the cycle in the plane X-Y  and t varies between 0 and 2π in the  right-hand direction full cycle. The factor **c** is constant so the value **2πc** to denote the vertical separation of the helix’s loop.

Next figure presents  the shape of a helix  drawn in the three dimensions.

<!-- 4. 3D Models -->

# 3D Models

Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via specialized software. The final product is called a 3D model.

3D models represent a physical body using a collection of points in 3D spaces, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc. 3D models can be created by hand, algorithmically (procedural modeling), or scanned. A 3D model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.

To produce 3D models, 3D modeling software is used. Examples are displayed in following sections.

# 3D Printing

3D printing is the process of making three dimensional solid objects that derive from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the object. Objects can be of almost of any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D Model or another electronic data source.

## 3D Printing Techniques

**Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)**. A common 3D printing technique that creates objects by melting filament and extruding it through a small nozzle that moves in three dimensions.

**Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)**. A 3D printing technology that uses high intensity light to sinter a powdered material.

**Stereolithography (SLA)**. A 3D printing technology which makes objects by using a high intensity light or a laser to harden a plastic resin

## 3D Printing Materials
When it comes to 3D Printing there are many materials one can choose from. Some of the most popular in use are presented below.

### PLA

Poly (lactic acid) or polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA) is a biodegradable (more nature friendly) and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch cassava roots, chips or starch, or sugarcane.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/3d-printer-filament-pla.jpg?w=456&h=428)

### ABS

ABS is derived from acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene. Acrylonitrile is a synthetic monomer produced from propylene and ammonia; butadiene is a petroleum hydrocarbon obtained from the C4 fraction of steam cracking; styrene monomer is made by dehydrogenationof ethyl benzene — a hydrocarbon obtained in the reaction of ethylene and benzene.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/abs1.jpg?w=596&h=260)

Other types of materials that can be used are: NYLON (Polyamide), Flexible, Polycarbonate, Wood PLA, Metal PLA etc.

## 3D Printer Parts

Before starting the 3D printing process you need to be informed of the 3D Printer’s parts. Every 3D Printer haw a user’s manual where all the printer’s parts are displayed and explained. For example, for the Ultimaker 2+ 3D Printer you can see the manual on the following link:

https://ultimaker.com/download/19573/UserManual_UM2+_EN.pdf

According to the manual listed above an Ultimaker 2+ 3D Printer has the parts shown in the following images:

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ultimaker-parts2.jpg)

## 3D Printing Implementation

When you have a 3D model ready for printing first you need to prepare a file suitable for your 3D Printer. If you have prepared an .STL or .OBJ file you need a slicing program to create the G-code that is actually a set of intructions for your 3D Printer. One popular slicing software for Ultimaker 3D Printers is the Cura Software.

# The Dice Cylinder Design Problem

## **Dice Games**

Dice games are board games played by dice. They are very popular especially among children. The backgammon, chuck-a-luck (bird cage), ludo etc are examples of dice games. A list of several dice games can be found at [http://www.dice-play.com/GamesAZ.htm](http://www.dice-play.com/GamesAZ.htm)

![eikona1](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona1.png?w=263&h=207)

Dice games are based on rules according to which a player throws the dice and depending on the result, an action is performed. In these games the random outcome of the dice is very important.  The dice must have enough space to roll several times so to end up randomly to their final position. Moreover, the throw should be such that the outcome is not determined by their initial status.

![eikona2](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona2.png?w=161&h=103)

## **The design problem**

Assume that you want to design an object that could help rolling the dice efficiently in a restricted space. Let such an object be a dice-cylinder, i.e. a cylinder that when the player lets the dice from the top, it will let them go down rolling and let them exit at the bottom level.

Such a dice-cylinder should :

1. Be easy to use
2. Allow one more dice roll down simultaneously
3. Assure the random outcome of the dice
4. Save space
5. Be fair. The player may not able to manipulate the throwing in any manner.

The problem of the dice-cylinder  is to think, design and implement a rolling path for the dice within the cylinder so to let them move and roll sufficient distance, greater than the height of the cylinder, so to ensure the random dice outcome. Moreover, the movement of the dice should be smooth, without obstacles and such to ensure that they will not stick in an intermediate position and come down directly.

## Directions for the design

Look carefully the following pictures (Source : [http://www.pexels.com](http://www.pexels.com)) What are the common design parts on these?

![eikona3](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona3.png?w=196&h=130)![eikona4](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona4.png?w=88&h=132)

Look at the metallic stair in the previous picture. You may notice the round tube-shaped central column and the stairs linked to it. The most important part of this stair is the helix shape.

Similar dice throwing objects has been previously designed and sold. For example in the e-shop [https://www.etsy.com/search?q=dice%20tower](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=dice%20tower) you may find different implementations of the basic vertical dice throwing idea. They are made of different materials (plastic, wood, paper etc.), shapes (tower, folding boxes, spiral cylinders etc.)

Below there are some pictures of such objects. In the rolling path of the dice, some of them use obstacles to ensure the random rolling and few of them use a helix stair.

A dice-cylinder should look like the following picture.

![eikona9](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona9.png?w=107&h=164)

To solve such a problem, consider the spiral theory. The path that follows the dice down to the exit of the cylinder may be a helix tube or a round staircase. Focusing to the case of the spiral stairs, several questions may arise:

* Why such a helix staircase might be an efficient structure in terms of space capacity and length of the rolling path?
* Given of some parameters such the height, the number of spirals, and the diameter of the cylinder base, how the helix staircase can be designed ? How long should be the helix path? How many stairs can be used in the specific cylinder height?

# The Dice Cylinder Basic Maths & Calculations

## The helix within a cylinder

But how one can easily design a helix ? Consider the following example.

Get a rectangular piece of paper and draw its diagonal with a pencil. Try to bend the paper so to gradually form a cylinder, a tube. Then, you may notice that the round shape automatically transforms the diagonal line to a helix ! This helix line will be the basic direction for the stairs to be linked. Further note that this is a simple, one spiral helix.

The following figure illustrates this structure.

![eikona10](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona10.png?w=590&h=220)

Further note that in the previous figure the helix is simple, with only one spiral. What will be the design if one wants to make a two-spiral helix? This is simple. Start by dividing the rectangular piece of paper into two equal horizontal parts (see next figure). Then draw the diagonals in both parts. If you bend this structure, the red lines will form a two-spiral helix.

![eikona11](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona11.png?w=322&h=155)

Helix with more than two spirals can be also formed by dividing the basic rectangular into appropriate number of equal parts.

Assuming that the helix column has been constructed, the stairs may be designed as equal triangles. The number of the steps required is depended on the height of the stair and the distance between two consecutive steps while their size is linked to the size of the circular base of the stair.

For example, if 12 steps are needed, the following figure presents the 12 equal triangles.

![eikona12](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona12.png?w=330&h=345)

To form the final stair structure, the triangle steps are linked with the helix in equal distances, as next figure presents.

## Mathematics of the helix

A 3D Archimedean spiral follows certain rules described by mathematical trigonometric equations, similar to those of a 2D spiral. File [The\_Dice\_Cylinder\_Long\_Learning\_Path.docx](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fTixXq1ow-ggx7BNahmdHWRxrCgkzPk7) contains the necessary supporting mathematical background for these.

In three dimensions we assume that a third axis z denoting the height is added to the plane. For that new axis and the two horizontal x, y , the equations are as follows:

![eikona14](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona14.png?w=300&h=148)

In the above equations,

* R represents the radius of the cycle in the plane X-Y  and
* t varies between 0 and 2π in the right-hand direction full cycle.
* factor c is constant so the value 2πc to denote the vertical separation of the helix’s loop.

Next figure presents  the shape of a helix  drawn in the three dimensions.

![eikona15](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona15.png?w=287&h=300)

## Basic calculations for the dice cylinder

As mentioned in previous texts, the proposed dice cylinder will include an internal helix staircase which will be the path for the dice. This document presents the basic calculations for that construction.

![eikona16](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona16.png?w=287&h=382)

By inspecting the basic structure, we notice that the basic part of the helix staircase is the inner cylinder column in which the triagonal-shaped stairs are adopted. The following figure presents these parts and shows the parameters used for the calculations.

![eikona17](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona17.png?w=542&h=408)

These are

**h** = the height of the stair

**R** = the radius of the basic cycle

**r** = the radius of the inner column

**d** = the distance (height) between two consecutive stairs

**θ** = the angle of the trigonal stair

**N** \= the number of stairs

Assume that the parameter **h, R, r** and **d** are predetermined and known, the rest  of them derive as follows :

The number of stairs **N** are dependent on the height **h** and the distance **d** between the stairs and related with the formula  **h = d (N+1)** By solving the equation, **N** derives as **N=1 – h/d**.

The base cycle is divided into N equal triangles, so their angle can be computed as  **θ = 3600 / Ν**

The inner column, seen as a cylinder with base radius **r** and when expanded, it forms a rectangle with height **h** and width the length of the inner cycle which is **2πr** (π=3,14).

The **N** stairs are placed in equal positions by using a grid. Next figure presents such a grid for **N=12** stairs.

![](https://spiralsdesignstem.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/eikona18.png?w=550&h=430)

The level of each stair is presented by the red line and the green diagonal line represents the helix path of the stair. The length **S** of this path is computed as the hypotenuse of the rectangular triangle with sides **h** and **2πr**. From the Pythagoras theorem derives that **S2 =(2πr)2+h2** so **S = square root ((2πr)2+h2).**

# Build the Dice Cylinder

## Instructions for the paper model

To construct the paper model of the dice staircase we need :

* 2 A4 sheets of thick paper where we print the template
* Pair of scissors
* Liquid paper glue
* Plastic A4 sheet e.g. overhead transparency film sheet

Follow the steps.

1. Open and print the pages of the template sheet.
2. Cut the 12 triangle stairs and the base.
