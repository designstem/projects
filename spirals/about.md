### Learning Goals

After the completion of this course, students will be able to recognize 2D and 3D shapes in nature, everyday life objects, engineering constructions etc, to understand their advantage in terms of space and energy efficiency,  to understand the mathematical background of spiral objects, to design and draw spirals in 2D/3D design software and to learn how to print spiral objects with a 3D printer.

### Motivation

Spirals are very common structures in nature, in constructions, in engineering and mechanics, in art etc. Spiral shapes in 2D/3D can be also found in everyday life objects. Spirals achieve optimal use of length, space and energy. The design and construction of a spiral object is a challenging DESIGN and STEM objective. This scenario, aiming to design and built variations of a typical spiral object (the dice cylinder), introduces students to the background mathematics and the software design and 3D printing tools.
