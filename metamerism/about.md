### About

~The workshop "Color perception/Metamerism" may be used to make students understand that different sources of light will change the way we perceive colors and that this effect is called metamerism. Students will experiment with different settings, name real world examples where metamerism occurs. In the end, solutions to these examples/problems are found and presented by students. The key aspect of the learning scenario is to make students aware of the relativeness of colors and the human perception of them.~

### Motivation

> As I am curious about experimenting with new technology and also creating something from scratch the combination of color perception with virtual reality environments offered the opportunity to do something completely new.
