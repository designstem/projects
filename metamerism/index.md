## Preface

This guideline is for teachers who want to use the learning scenario ‚ÄúColor Perception / Metamerism‚Äù in their lessons. You are provided with learning goals, a sample lesson plan, and some impulse questions to get students engaged in the learning process. Please bear in mind that this is exemplarily and may be adapted to your specific needs and to fit the levels of your students and classes.

## Learning goals

The learning scenario may be used to make students understand that different sources of light will change the way we perceive colors and that this effect is called metamerism. Students will experiment with different settings, name real-world examples where metamerism occurs. In the end, solutions to these examples/problems are found and presented by students. The critical aspect of the learning scenario is to make students aware of the relativeness of colors and the human perception of them.

## Experiment 1

-

In the example of the dress, you have seen that the same object may look differently. Some might say it is white and gold; others see it as black and blue. But what is true?

To find out more about colors and light, you are going to do an experiment in a virtual learning environment.

-

Use a computer or your smartphone (with a VR headset if possible) and enter the first experiment.

1. Make yourself familiar with the VR environment (moving, viewing, controls ...)

2. Experiment with the buttons. Which effect do they have?

## Materials needed

- Internet access
- Browsers that support the technical requirements (recent versions of Chrome and Firefox are tested and work)
- Computers and/or smartphones (with VR headsets if available)
- For smartphones and tablets: the QR-code reader app suggested - but not compulsory. The learning scenario will work in 2D, as well. Experimenting in 3D/VR is a bonus experience with higher immersion into the project.
- Pens and paper (to take down notes and answer the questions on the worksheets)

## Using the e-tools of the scenario

Important note for teachers: Make sure to thoroughly explain the tasks on the worksheets BEFORE introducing the VR learning scenario to students! Computers, smartphones, and VR usually are so exciting for students that there is hardly a chance to add any piece of information after telling students to use these means.

Make yourself familiar with the learning scenario. There are specific instructions on the worksheets for students. It is recommended that teachers do the exercises before the lessons.

Each e-tool scenario has a short introduction that recaps the findings of the previous step. Additionally, the assignment is given to the students.

## Exemplary lesson plan (approximately 180 to 270 minutes)

Please feel free to adapt the structure and contents according to your schools‚Äô specific needs and levels of your students. It is, of course, possible to leave out steps or to spend more time on tasks to go into details. You can use the slides as a guideline for the lesson/s.

# Engage

1. Welcome the students and introduce the learning goals of the lesson/s.
2. Start with the picture of the dress and ask the students the question, ‚ÄúWhich colors does this dress have?‚Äù
   Hopefully, students will argue about ¬ªwhite and gold¬´ versus ¬ªblue and black¬´. The teacher should give students a guideline in the discussion and make them find reasons for their point of view.

# Explore and Explain

3. Experiment 1: ‚ÄúWhat is true: White and gold or black and blue?‚Äù.
   Students now have the opportunity to experiment within a VR environment (dress which looks differently when lighting is changed).
4. Exercise 1: ‚ÄúHow does lighting affect our perception of colors?‚Äù. Students discover that there is no wrong or right in this scenario. The colors of the dress change according to the lighting.
5. Experiment 2: ‚ÄúHow do objects react under different lighting?‚Äù
   Students enter the second VR learning scenario and experiment with the basic colors of the additive color mixing system. There are a red tomato, a green apple, and an orange which are affected by RGB lighting.
6. Exercise 2: ‚ÄúThe effects of additive color lighting.‚Äù
   Students name the objects and the basic colors of light (RGB) in the scene. Background information on the color mixing can be found in the section ‚Äúfurther reading‚Äù. At the end of this exercise, students fill out tables with the effects of different RGB lighting on the objects. The conclusion is most likely done with some help from the teacher.
7. Optional: Experiment 3: ‚ÄúWhich kind of lighting is ideal in crucial situations?‚Äù
   Use some printed Ishihara tables (ishihara_01.jpg and ishihara_02.jpg) and expose these to different sources of light (pure red, green or blue lighting; use combinations of RGB, any other tints or warm white versus cold white lighting; be creative!) for showing, for example, red-green color-deficiencies under different colors of light.
   Students find out that the human perception of colors needs standardized sources of light. Otherwise, we can not pass an Ishihara test successfully.
8. Task: ‚ÄúExplain the connection between lighting and the way we see colors.‚Äù
   Conclusion: ‚ÄúLight influences our perception of colors. If the color of two (or more) objects look the same under one type of lighting and differ under another type of lighting, it is called metamerism‚Äù.

# Extend

9. Task: ‚ÄúWhen does lighting affect colors? Find examples (work, hobby, everyday life ‚Ä¶)‚Äù

Students find examples of changing colors when objects or persons are exposed to different
sources of light. Possible Examples:

White balance (photography/film making)
Buying clothes (artificial versus sunlight)
Judging colors of printed products under different sources of light. Especially crucial in color management (screen/print)

# Evaluate

10. Task: ‚ÄúFind solutions to your example of color change. Present them to the others!‚Äù.

Students get together in groups and choose one of the examples from the ¬ªextend¬´-section (number 9). They gather more information on the topic and find solutions to the problem of metamerism in this specific field. The groups present their results and solutions to the other students. This presentation can be done the way that suits the student‚Äôs and school‚Äôs demands (or limitations) best. It might be done by using posters, whiteboards, flipcharts, videos, expressive dances, pc, and beamer based slides.

Do whatever you think suits your situation best and be creative!

## Experiment 2

-

You have seen that lighting can have an enormous effect on the way the human eye perceives colors. Our perception of colors is affected very much by light.

The effect on the dress was already clearly visible. But there are changes which may be more subtle or more drastic.

Use a computer or your smartphone (with a VR headset if
possible) and enter the second experiment.

1. Use the buttons to experiment with different colored lightning.

2. Try different combinations and watch the consequences
   on the scene and the objects.
