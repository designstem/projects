### About

The aim of the scenario is to get students thinking about the serious problem of floating plastic waste that forms real plastic islands in the seas and oceans.
The students are therefore invited to understand the physical principle that causes the floating of plastic waste, to conceive them as a resource and to design floating structures useful to society.

### Motivation

> ~*It is important that the younger generations are particularly attentive to protecting the environment, as one of the 8 key competences of European Union for lifelong learning and European citizenship (Social and civic competences), in particular with regard to the problem of plastic in our seas and oceans. Man has understood how fragile the balance of the marine environment is and how much is in danger due to the plastic objects that are so present in the daily life of us all. <br/> We must therefore know the problem, know what plastics are, what types of plastics we use most often, that we find in our seas and threaten the ecosystem. <br/> The property of plastic waste to float on water is a threat to the marine environment but can be exploited by society to create floating structures like the floating parks of Rotterdam or the Christo designed walkway on  Iseo Lake. Inviting students, who will be the citizens of tomorrow, to reflect, to change perspective and to respect the balance of each ecosystem I think is the challenge of every teacher.*~
