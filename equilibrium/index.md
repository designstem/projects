## Plastic pollution

Our sea is covered by "plastic floating islands", because plastic can not only sink but also float. It pollutes the sea at all depths.

<br>

<caption>üì∫üí¨ Watch and discuss</caption>

1. Watch the following video about a diver in Bali and learn about sea pollution.

2. How does the video make you feel?

3. Did you ever come across water pollution like this close to where you live (for example in lakes or rivers)?

4. Find out about organizations that try to counteract sea pollution.

## Plastic fantastic?

Plastic is a multi-purpose material. There are different categories of plastic, which have different properties and are therefore used for different products.

<br>

<caption>üíªüí¨ Research and discuss</caption>

1. Find out what the following abbreviations mean.

  <var>PET&nbsp; LDPE&nbsp; PP&nbsp; HDPE&nbsp; PVC&nbsp; PS</var>

2. Not only find out about their properties, but also about their main usage.

3. When you are done <a class="tertiary" href="../plastics" target="_blank">learn how plastic floats and sinks</a> and therefore in which way plastic causes sea pollution.

## The bad news is...

Plastic is everywhere and poisons our environment. It not only destroys nature, but also **kills animals**, who eat it, suffocate by it or get trapped in it. And in the end, through the food chain, it also affects our health.

<br>

<caption>üíªüí¨ Research and discuss</caption>

### Get informed!

You can find more information on this via <f-link to="https://www.peta.org/">PeTA</f-link>. Search for **plastic** and you will find many articles which are related to plastic hurting animals.

Further you can find more information on plastic destroying nature via <f-link to="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/">Greenpeace</f-link>. Also search for the keyword **plastic** and find out where it destroys nature's beauty.

## The good news is...

There are eco friendly substitutes for plastic, that you can use. See the links <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-tech/sustainable/5-plastic-substitutes.htm" target="_blank">Top 10 Eco-friendly Substitutes for Plastic</a>, <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/wax-worms-eat-plastic-polyethylene-trash-pollution-cleanup/" target="_blank">Worms eating plastic</a> and <a href="https://www.explainthatstuff.com/bioplastics.html" target="_blank">Bioplastics and biodegradable plastics</a> (see the picture)

<caption>üíªüëÅÔ∏èüí¨ Observe, research and discuss</caption>

1. Find other eco friendly substitutes for plastic or other similar projects.
2. Look around at your home. How much plastic do you use? Find out if there are alternatives for items made of plastic, e.g. there are toothbrushes made of bamboo.
3. Come up with ideas on how to avoid plastic in your everyday life. Use the internet as a research tool.
4. Discuss your ideas in class. Is it very difficult to be eco friendly?

## Plastic reuse & art

So plastic can also be used to make you walk on water, see <a href="https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-floating-piers">Christo "The Floating Piers", 2016

1. What are your feelings about this installation? Is it interesting, beautiful or even stupid and redundant? Find out about the artists' reasons for creating it.

2. Which physical laws are used in this example to keep the piers floating even when people walked on them? **Focus on the following two terms** and find out what they mean. Write down your results:

<caption>üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on activity</caption>

## Build a boat

1. Collect plastic objects around you in your everyday life. Find as many as you can.  

2. Research the type of plastic they are made of. What is their floating or sinking behaviour?

3. Design a boat or other floating structure. You can build it for one person or several people. Try to make your design work. <a href="https://observers.france24.com/en/20170804-tunisia-holds-world-first-sea-race-boats-made-out-recycled-materials" target="_new">Use this example as a clue</a>. If there is no lake or river close to you, you can also build a smaller version of your boat and test it in the sink or bath tub.

4. Verify that a boat can float even if it is made out of plastic that usually sinks. What is the reason for it? For further information, see this link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xniW3_afO-0" target="_blank">How do ships float?</a>

5. Finally, calculate your boat's weight and its buoyancy in water.

## Let's experiment! ‚õµ

<big>Does your boat float? How much weight can you add to your object before it sinks?</big>

-

##### 1.

**Measure the volume** of your boat. Hint: Fill it with water then pour the water into a measuring cup. The amount of water that was in the boat tells you its volume.

##### 2.

Calculate how many grams of water the boat can hold (1 ml of water = 1 g).

##### 3.

Float the empty boat and start adding quarters, one at a time. Add them slowly so you don‚Äôt flip the boat over! What happens to the boat as you add quarters? How many quarters does it take to sink the boat?

-

##### 4.

Calculate how many grams of quarters were needed to sink the boat. One quarter of water has a mass of about 5.67 g.

##### 5.

Compare the total mass of water that sinks the boat, to the mass of water that fills the boat (see step 2). What do you notice?

## Examine your boat

#### Checklist:

1. Is it only made by reusing/repurposing plastic?

2. Does it have an environmental purpose? 

3. Can it float when stressed with more weight, or with movements or even if it is distorted from its original shape?

## Think further!

1. Think of alternative uses for this project. Where would it be handy to create floating objects out of used plastic objects?
2. Could this be useful in product design or even in developing countries, where, sadly, a lot of our plastic waste ends up?

<br>

See for example the following project, where Alfredo Moser from Brazil invented a way to make lives (literally) brighter by repurposing used plastic bottles:
