How much weight can you add to your object before it sinks?
Measure the volume of your "boat". Hint: fill it with water then pour the water into a measuring cup. The amount of water that was in the boat tells you its volume.
Calculate how many grams of water the boat can hold (1 ml of water = 1 g).
Float the empty boat and start adding quarters one at a time. Add them slowly so you don’t flip the boat over! What happens to the boat as you add quarters? How many quarters does it take to sink the boat?
Calculate how many grams of quarters were needed to sink the boat. One quarter of water has a mass of about 5.67 g.
Compare the total mass of water that sink the boat to the mass of water that fills the boat (see step 2). What do you notice?
