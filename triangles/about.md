### Learning goals

In this scenario, students learn that if you want to make calculations in geometric forms, it all comes down to simplifying and work in small incremental steps with a right-angled triangle where you can make your calculations using the theorem of Pythagoras, sine, cosine, and tangent.

### Motivation

> *~In my experience I find that students make what they know. Giving them tools, knowledge and having them explore that things are not as complicated as they seem, helps to expend their horizon and opens a world of possibilities for them to make whatever they want -- by making they are motivated to learn and develop skills for their profession.~*
