## Overview

Study Project "Natural Dyes" approaches the subject of chemical bonds in biology/chemistry via environmental issues by combining practical chemistry work with art/design-centered tasks and processes. 

Final aim of the study project is to **develop environmentally sustainable product**, which originates from recycling and reusing resources in order to reduce the environmental damage caused by textile and fashion industry.

## Suggestions

* Items to be dyed should be chosen by students themselves. Preferably, if they should come up with a special idea and/or develop the product. However, the product may be a ready-made item, carrying and environmental message, such as T-shirts, socks, blouses, shawls or headscarves.

* These items should be completely from natural (white) fibers, such as cotton, silk, wool and linen.

* Encourage students to recycle both textiles and colouring agents. Textile items could be picked up from second-hand stores.

* A distributable message should be constructed by students, with the teacher offering support, if needed.

* Encourage students plan the whole process at the beginning, including the core message to be spread.

* Inform your students at least one week before the start of chemistry part of the project, so they have sufficient time to collect food residue and prepare other necessary materials.

* You need to be prepared: assemble all materials required for the project to ensure successful completion.

***NOTE:*** There are several possible learning paths that could be followed during this learning project, depending on the interests and aims of both teachers and students. You could integrate this learning material with other study projects.

## Time

**Quicklook:** 30 min

**Full project:** up to 20 hrs during a 3-6 weeks period: 12-16 hrs depending on the dyeing process chosen and the level of task difficulty chosen, plus 4 hrs for production of group poster to present essential facts and for pitching the idea and product

## Class setting

* Individual work, groups of 3-4 students
* Joint discussions and analyses in class lead by the teacher

## Materials

* Fiber / clothes to be dyed
* Food waste with coloring agents
vRusty metal items
* Soy milk
* Aluminum pot
* Wooden spoons
* Fabric to filter fluid (string or cord)
* Glass jars
* Water
* Stove
* Large paper
* Coloured markers

## The power of T-Shirt: wearing a message

British fashion designer **Vivienne Westwood** started a revolutionary mission by raising awareness on global climate issues, crossing age and state borders, thus allowing people to express their attitudes and values.

https://blog.viviennewestwood.com/the-story-so-far/

Nowadays, mitigation of climate change is no longer an option, if we are to keep planet Earth habitable.

## The power of the T-Shirt: wearing a message

Nowadays, the message T-shirt, is an iconic fashion item, used to deliver information to wide target groups. Regrettably T-shirts with a message happens to be overused. 

With its roots in subcultures, the message T-shirt has been taken over by the marketing industry and has become the main agent of communication.

Is the excessive production and overuse of Fast Fashion items worth the environmental damage they cause? What can we do about it?

##  Greenwashing

People are becoming more and more aware of the environmental issues. In 2015, global performance management company, [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com), that provides a comprehensive understanding of what consumers watch and buy,  reported that [73 percent of Millennials are willing to pay more for sustainable goods](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-releases/2015/consumer-goods-brands-that-demonstrate-commitment-to-sustainability-outperform/).

***TASK***

**Discuss in your group:** Are you willing to pay more for sustainable goods? Why or why not? Give some examples.

##  Greenwashing 2

However, some companies are becoming more adept at falsely claiming to be "green" by promoting environmentally-friendly initiatives or images without actually implementing business practices that minimize environmental impact. 

This type of promotion is termed "green washing", a term coined in the 1980s by the environmentalist [Jay Westerveld](https://www.revolvy.com/page/Jay-Westerveld). 

More on history of Greenwashing [A History of Greenwashing: How Dirty Towels Impacted the Green Movement](https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212726/http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/12/the-history-of-greenwashing-how-dirty-towels-impacted-the-green/) by Jim Motvalli, Daily Finance.

<f-notes>

The Oxford English Dictionary defines <var>greenwashing</var> as the "dissemination is misinformation by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image." This may involve misleading advertising, unsubstantiated claims or omission of important facts. For example, one clothing manufactures who claimed to sell eco-friendly bamboo-clothing actually sold rayon produced from bamboo. Processing of rayon uses harsh chemicals and releases hazardous air pollutants. Another manufacturer celebrated its position as the top user of organic cotton (grown without the use of harmful pesticides), yet only 13.7% of the cotton used by this company is organic.

| section: Choosing the fabric

## Choosing the fabric

There are many aspects to consider when **choosing the fabric** to be dyed. Most of the natural fabrics are made either of **cellulose** (modal, viscose rayon, cotton, hemp, bamboo, linen) or **protein** (soy fibre, silk, wool). See more in the comprehensive [list of  textile fibers by its source](https://www.textileschool.com/amp/2782/comprehensive-list-of-textile-fibers/).

Often dyes used are **toxic** to humans or polluting the environment (e.g. azo dyes).

One of the ways to be more  conscious environmentally is to use natural dyes, for example **food residues that contain tannins** (list). Tannins act as natural mordants.

A greater variety of dyes can be used for dyeing protein fibres. You will find out why soon!

<f-notes>

Bring several strips of natural fabrics to the classroom, so students can touch the fabric and feel/realize the difference.

Include cellulose-based and protein-based natural fabrics.

Also introduce man-made synthetic fabrics for students to compare to natural fabrics.

| section: Mordants
| 1 1 1
| 2 3 3

## Mordants

People are becoming more conscious about the issues related to fast fashion and use of toxic dyes. One of the least mentioned topics is <var>mordant</var>.

It is important to consider the environmental benefits of using natural dyes since most natural dyes are not particularly toxic in themselves. However, a mordant is invariably required for development of shade and dye fixation.

Typically, a mordant is a heavy metal salt of **aluminum, iron, copper, chromium or tin** and can have an detrimental effect on our health and on the environment

-

<img src="./images/pot.jpg"/>

-

There are some alternatives to using the metal salts mordants. For example the material of the pot used for extracting the dye and dyeing can have an mordanting effect and different materials lead to different colors. Usually iron pots darken the color especially if there are tannins present, whereas aluminum pots help to bring out the yellows from brown onion peels.

##  Mordants

The list of alternatives is long and includes **vinegar, soy milk, buffalo milk** and **urine**. You can read more about the topic here:
http://www.textilestudio.ca/guest%20artists/flint1.html

Different traditional cultures have found their own unique ways to fix the color onto fabric. For example, soy milk is used in Japan. You can buy it from the shops or make your own.

| section: Choosing the fabric 2

## Choosing the fabric 2

One of the aspects to think about when choosing the fabric is to consider how much water has been consumed and polluted in the process of making the fabric. Other important aspects to consider are use of land, use of <var>pesticides</var>. Here you can find useful links to further research the environmental impact of different fabrics. 

#### TASK

Pick an article and research it. Presenting your findings concisely during discussion.

https://www.textileschool.com/154/eco-friendly-fibers/

https://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-fashion/do-you-know-which-fabrics-are-most-sustainable.html

<f-notes>

Teacher notes:

You might want to present some interesting facts at the beginning of the topic. These facts should be chosen according to the interests of the group.

Pick an interesting piece of information, visualize it.

Allow students to analyse the articles and present information during follow-up discussion.

**Alternative pathway**: at this point,there is an excellent opportunity to include social justice issues.

##  Collecting the food residues

The following food residues containing tannins, can be used:

1. pomegranate peels (these give a yellow shade, using an aluminum pot)
2. avocado peels (these give a pink shade, using an aluminum pot)
3. avocado stones (these give a pink shade, using an aluminum pot)

Keep the materials in a dark, dry place. Drying of food residue is not compulsory. 

Note: Do not use food residues that have mould growing on them.

<f-notes>

Avocado stones account for approximately 12% of the total weight on an avocado.

</f-notes>

* Work in small groups

* Use your notes and discuss your experiments.

* Create a process map on large paper to explain the process of dyeing.

* Present your map to other members of your class.

<f-notes>

Let the students work in small groups. Students who have experimented with similar materials, could create a joint process map.

The map could be the final step of biochemistry part and may conclude with an evaluation.

See more: https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/process-mapping-guide/

#### What is a Process Map?

A process map visually shows the steps of a work activity and the people who are involved in carrying out each step.

When mapping a process you simply draw a box for each step and connect them with arrows to show the direction of flow.

##  Design thinking

**Design Thinking** has evolved from Human-Centered Design focusing on customer experience, to Service Design focusing on customer journeys and touch points between a business and its customer.

Design Thinking is a step-by-step, user-centered method to creative thinking and innovation, which is based on the [building up](https://experience.sap.com/skillup/introduction-to-design-thinking/) of ideas. Generally, Design Thinking follows a five-step approach:

## TODO: title

Although you are following the stages of a certain process, it might be confusing to find the solution to the problem. 

It is normal for a creative process to move freely between different thoughts. 

Allow yourself to think freely; keep notes/record of your ideas; listen to your teammates and feel free to develop every idea that evokes new thoughts. 

Eventually, you will find the answer :)

| section: Presenting ideas

##  Presenting ideas

After the process of product ideation is finished, the ideas are to be presented to the audience; and the whole class should be engaged. Feel free to present sketches, visualizations and/or example models of your product.

Groups should introduce their ideas briefly, covering information such as:

1. Name/description of your product
2. End users and/or target group of your product
3. Name the problem(s), that are to be solved by using your product.

Your audience should be encouraged to ask questions to refine and develop the idea, or to propose alternative solutions.

---

## Refining ideas

After presenting your ideas to your classmates, discuss the results within your group.


***Subtask 1:*** Is the process of making your product is sustainable?

***Subtask 2:*** use the design thinking process with your group again (***TODO*** See slide 39) and **find out and describe, how it is possible to make your process and/or product even more sustainable.** Remember themes you discussed earlier in biochemistry part of the learning project, such as issues of greenwashing, industrial textile production and fashion industry problems.

## Preparing the marketing pitch for your product 

**Pitch**, also named **marketing pitch**, is a presentation of a **business idea** to potential investors.

People pitch ideas, because they need **resources** to fulfill their ideas. If the goal is to raise startup cash, the target of the pitch is an investor.

Other businesses pitch to potential **customers** to sell their product. Pitching is part of preparing the introduction of your idea and product to the audience and/or future customers.

***SUBTASK 1*** Prepare the pitching presentation about your product. Rehearse within your group. Make your pitch stand out. 

***SUBTASK 2*** Present your pitching presentation to your class. 

<f-notes>

It is possible to arrange the pitching of ideas as a part of an assessment.

| section: Core message

***TODO: Titlecard***

## Core message

***TASK*** Create a visual design for your product

### Core message and idea 

Phrase the message so that it clear enough to extend public understanding about environmental issues and matches your product.

##### 1.

Write the message on paper. Rephrase and ask for help on language if needed. Test your message by presenting it to target audience.

##### 2.

Think about lettering; pick or draw any images you intend to use.

##### 3.

Brainstorm in your group which items or products could both carry the message required *and* be sustainable.

##  Creating the visuals of your product

##### 4.

Sketch your items and/or design on the paper by hand. Try to make variations, visualize and develop the idea, keep in mind the simplicity of the expression and composition :)

##### 5.

Digitalize your design. The simplest way is to take photo with your smartphone.

##### 6.

Process your images in a graphic software package of your choice to make the etched model of your product. 

-

The visual message should be designed in a simplified and/or stylized  visual mode.

Remember to use enough contrast

| section: Making models

## Make digital / visual models of your product

##### 7.

Analyse examples given by your teacher together with your classmates.

##### 8.

With your group, analyse legibility of the message design, visual hierarchy, colour contrast and overall wholeness of the item and designed message, while fitting your design on the sketch of your product (use graphic software of your choice) or on a T-shirt (use graphic testing module of T-shirt). Think about consistency. 

##### 9.

Ask for others' opinions on purposefulness of your message and (product) design. Do they match? Try different variations, if required. 

<f-notes>

Prepare a set of product design examples that are suited to the interests and outcomes of the product development stage of your gr oup.

Examples may be both digital (photos, videos) and physical (items).

Demonstrate the analysis for a couple of examples and support the class with guiding questions.

</f-notes>

| section: Matching design and technique

##  Matching design and technique

##### 11.

Keep in mind that you are supposed to use only natural color and mordant agents to complete your task. Experiment to find the best way for applying design onto your item. Make further changes to your design item if necessary.  If you plan to make several items, be ready for differences, as outcome may differ due to the dyeing process.

##### 12.

Make changes to your visual model, applying the knowledge you achieved of dyeing (and use process map you've made). Again, analyse legibility, visual hierarchy, colour contrast as you did before to find out, whether your design is deliverable by a natural dyeing process.
 
<f-notes>

It is essential to support students through the analyse process. As your students' ability to analyse both details and whole entity of the item and design is still evolving, they will develop observation and analysis skills.

##  Process map

### Task: make design process map of your own products full stack process

##### 12.

Repeat steps 4-11, if necessary. 

<p />

When you are happy with your product and design, it is time to look back and analyse the product design process as a whole.

***SUBTASK*** Using the design process chart as model <small>(see teacher notes)</small>, create your own chart with **clearly stated outcomes of each stage** together with your teammates. 

**Present your work** and help other groups by asking questions about what they have reached.

-

<img src="./images/pineappletshirt.jpg" />

<f-notes>

It is essential to support and encourage students through the analysis process. As they lack experience to analyse both details and whole entity of the item and design and their competencies are still evolving, this is the most valuable experience they get out of design and development stage of their project.

Have large papers or flipchart and markers ready for each group. Explain the chart to the class briefly

Instruct each group to make process map of their own work according to the example

Let each group present their flipchart and encourage other students to ask questions straight after the presentation.

Encourage students to make additions to their process maps.

This task may serve as process evaluation tool, should you need to grade your students; as the design stage ends here.

##  Product dyeing process

First of all, **you need to plan ahead for the dyeing process**. 

It is best to do this with your teammates. 

Discuss which dyeing techniques would best suit to your design.

Remember to use your previous experience from the biochemistry section, and your Process Map.

Think abut how using different techniques, such as tie-dye, stencil, iron rust etc. would be used to transfer your design onto your item. You can also combine different techniques to achieve a more artistic approach.

## Transfer the design


***SUBTASK 1*** create Dyeing Protocol of your product 

***SUBTASK 2*** conduct the Dyeing Process accordingly

Decide, how will you transfer your design to your item. (And still, if necessary, adapt your design.) Keep in mind, what kind of colour shades you will be able to gain (use your previous knowledge). 

---

## Transfer techniques

To bring the pattern or text on the t-shirt, you could try:

A. Shibori technique to tie/fold the elements which will not be wearing the colour; 

B. Stencil technique to cover the part of the item which will not be wearing the colour;  

C. Use iron water to make the colours on the areas of design darker;

D. Pretreat the fabric by painting the pattern/text with soy milk.

Follow the steps for dyeing the fabric, that you have use slides on Exploration 4). <!-- ***TODO LINK*** -->

NOTE: Keep the record of colouring process, time and results. 

<f-notes>

Demonstrate examples of techniques.
