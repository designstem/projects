### Learning Goals

Students learn to define <var style="color: var(--blue)">frequency</var> and <var style="color: var(--blue)">motion</var> <var style="color: var(--gray)">philosophically</var> and <var style="color: var(--gray)">technologically</var> by <var style="color: var(--gray)">hands-on</var> tasks such as creating a simple <var style="color: var(--blue)">analogue animation </var> with the help of the turntable. 

### Motivation

> <big>~*It is clear that as technology is advancing rapidly, teaching and its methods are evolving towards digitization. Thus, it's not all negative by itself, I decided to create a project, which lets students creativeness explore the world out of screen resolution limits. The main goal of the project is driven by creative tasks which intrigue students to raise questions and find answers. Frequency and motion adds creativity to STEM!*~</big><br>Erik Riige
