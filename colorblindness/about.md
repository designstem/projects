### About

The scenario on "Color Vision Deficiency and Accessibility" can be used to learn about accessibility, color design basics (such as color mixing, three properties of color, color contrast and color harmony theory, design rules for creating color palettes as well as CVD proof color palettes) and STEM related topics such as the function of the eye concerning color vision and the different types of color blindness and CVD in an integrated way. 

Teachers can modify the lesson plan and adjust it to their needs resp. their classes needs (change levels of difficulty, leave out topics, add connecting topics at the end etc.).

### Motivation

> ~*The idea to create a scenario on Color Vision Deficiencies developed due to my experience with my best friend. He is colorblind and I saw him struggle in everyday situations.<br><br>Since I am a graphic designer, it always made me angry to see the mistakes other designers made when they created color schemes for websites, posters, packagings or brochures. At school, I also frequently teach color design, therefore I am aware that color blindness is no topic in any curriculum that I know of.<br><br>So I thought, "let's change this", by making designers aware of this problem and giving them the tools to understand how to create color palettes that also work for a person with CVD*~
