## Light and color

<!-- <f-hr style="margin:var(--base6) 0" /> -->

Color is derived from light, either natural or artificial. With little light, little or no color is present. With a lot of light comes lots of color.

#### Task

1. *Go outside or look out of your window before the sun comes up. Experience how you steadily can see more colors while the sun rises and how the intensitiy of the colors changes. (Alternatively: If you have curtains or shutters, close them and look at the room you are in and at the colors you can see. Then slowly open them and see how the colors of the objects in the room start to change with more light entering).*
2. *Further, realize how light can have different colors. We call this effect <var>color temperature</var>. For example candle light is more red and very different from the light of a fluorescent tube. In the picture on the right, you can also see this effect. In the evening, more light with red wavelengths is dispersed in the atmosphere, therefore red light hits the landscape and makes it look like we applied a red filter to the picture.*

Our eyes have three color receptor cells or cones: red, green and blue. As a result, all incoming light is reduced to these colors. **All perceived colors are generated by a mixture of these three colors**, depending on the intensity of the light. Find out more on the next page.

## Additive Color System

In the Additive Color System, **<span style="color:red;" v-on:mouseover="set('activeCol', 'red')">RED</span>**, **<span style="color:lime;" v-on:mouseover="set('activeCol', 'lime')">GREEN</span>** and **<span style="color:hsl(230, 100%, 70%);" v-on:mouseover="set('activeCol', 'blue')">BLUE</span>** are the primary colors. When all three colors overlap, **WHITE** light is produced.

#### Task

1. *Have a look at the RGB Model for additive color mixing and find out about its three secondary colors (which are also the primary colors for the CMY Model, called Subtractive Color System). What are secondary colors?*

2. *Find out where the RGB Model is used?*

3. *Complementary colors are opposite of each other and form white light. Find out about the complementary color pairs in the RGB Model.*

<br>

<details>
	<summary>Check your answers - but don't cheat.</summary>
 
**Answer key**
 
1. The three secondary colors are: Magenta (mixed through red and blue light), Cyan (mixed through green and blue light) and yellow (mixed through red and green light).

2. Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, OLED, quantum dotsâ€¦), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays and large screens such as JumboTron. Color printers, on the other hand are not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices (typically CMYK color model).
If you want to find out about the subtractive color model, see this [wikipedia text on the subtractive color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color).

3. Green and Magenta, Blue and Yellow, Red and Cyan.

## Mix RGB Colors

Now that you know about the RGB color system, **look at these two colors**. They are both made up in parts of red, green and blue.


#### Task

1. *In your mind, try to disassemble them into their three color components (red, green and blue). How much red, green and blue would you need to create these colors? A lot? Only little?*

2. *Take some notes of your assumptions. Test your ideas on the next page.*

&nbsp;

**To get you started, here is some information about the RGB color system's values.**

<details>
	
<summary>How does the RGB system work when I want to pick a color?</summary>
	
When you pick a color in the RGB color model, depending on the layout you can always see three sliders or forms where you can fill in numbers manually. Three because we need one for each channel/color: Red, Green and Blue.
The values that you can pick go from 0 (for no light, 0%) to 255 (for full light, 100%).
If you have the value 255,0,0, this means that you get a very bright red.
	
<figure style="width:100%; height:100%; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items: flex-start; margin: 0;">
	<img src="./images/cvd_rgb_picker.jpg" />
</figure>
      
Of course I can pick whatever color I want, therefore I can alter the values in all three channels randomly until I get the color I want. See in the following example:
	
<figure style="width:100%; height:100%; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items: flex-start; margin: 0;">
	<img src="./images/cvd_rgb_picker2.jpg" />
</figure>
	
For those of you, who already know their way around bits and bytes, this means that we have 8 bits per channel, therefore we get (256 x 256 x 256 = )  16777216 combinations of R, G and B, therefore over 16 million different colors that we can display. Neat, isn't it?

## Mix RGB Colors

Now, **check your assumptions** by adjusting the RGB controllers so that you receive a color that is as similar as possible to the given example. <br> But **first think**, then pull the sliders.
